# Architectural Solution for Explainable Agentic AI Control Layer

## Introduction
### Background
The Decision-Making Group is developing two complementary AI frameworks that push the frontier of
enterprise decision automation:
1. an ontology-driven knowledge graph (KG) architecture combined with multi-agent semantic
reasoning for reliable decision-making, and
2. a dynamic multi-agent system capable of progressive expert-level upskilling, enabling adaptive
execution of complex tasks requiring human-like (micro)decisions.

Together, these systems aim to create AI assistants that can reason, coordinate, learn, and execute
decisions in a structured and interpretable way. However, for enterprise adoption, advanced backend
intelligence is not enough. Organizations require transparency, oversight, and user-centered control over
autonomous agents and semantic decision engines.  
A major open challenge in the field is how to expose complex semantic reasoning, highlight the most
relevant explanations, and offer meaningful human control over automated decision flows, without
overwhelming users with unnecessary detail. This thesis addresses this gap by building an explainability-
driven interaction and control layer that unifies and exposes the capabilities of the systems.
### Thesis Description
This thesis will design and implement a web-based control and explainability layer that enables enterprise
users to supervise, understand, and interact with semantic reasoning decision systems. The layer will
integrate outputs from the ontology-driven decision-support system and the dynamic multi-agent
upskilling architecture, forming a unified interface for operating AI decision makers and executors.
The project will focus on practical UX design, explainability exposure, and progressive disclosure of
reasoning, allowing users to explore decision traces, conflict resolution, and KG–based inference paths.
The following steps are envisioned as part of the thesis work:
1. Conduct a structured review of explainability frameworks, semantic reasoning interfaces, and
human-in-the-loop control models for multi-agent systems.
2. Design UX flows and interaction patterns for exposing reasoning steps, decision chains, KG
insights, and multi-agent behaviors.
3. Develop a unified API layer that integrates reasoning outputs, agent states, and execution logs.
4. Implement an interactive web platform that enables users to: inspect reasoning paths; monitor
conflicts; access prioritized XAI explanations and supervise or override decisions.

## Goal
In this Architectural Solution document, I assume a _hypothetical scenario_ where the goal is to design an **explainable Agentic AI Control Layer** that allows users to understand and interact with autonomous agents making complex decisions. 
This scenario involves the following key objectives:
1. Design a domain ontology that captures the relevant concepts, relationships, and decision-making criteria for the agents.
2. Design a knowledge graph (KG) that represents the ontology and supports semantic reasoning.
3. Design a multi-agent system where agents can autonomously make decisions based on the KG and progressively upskill their expertise.
4. Design an explainability layer that exposes the reasoning processes of the agents, allowing users to inspect decision paths, conflicts, and explanations.
5. Design a web-based interface that enables users to interact with the agents, monitor their actions, and provide feedback or overrides.

## Employee Trip Budget Approval (the hypothetical scenario)
### Scenario Description
1. In this scenario, we have an enterprise system where employees can submit trip requests for business travel.  
2. Each trip request includes details such as employee ID, destination, duration, purpose, and estimated costs.
3. Managers are responsible for reviewing and approving these trip requests based on company policies, budget constraints, and individual employee entitlements.
4. The system should provide transparency into the decision-making process, allowing employees and managers to understand why certain requests were approved or denied (Explainability).
### Ontology Design
1. Key concepts: Employee, TripRequest, Manager, ApprovalDecision, CompanyPolicy, Budget, Entitlement.
2. Relationships: Employee submits TripRequest; Manager reviews TripRequest; ApprovalDecision is based on CompanyPolicy, Budget, and Entitlement.
3. Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD):
   ```
   [Employee] --submits--> [TripRequest] --reviewed by--> [Manager]
   [TripRequest] --results in--> [ApprovalDecision]
   [ApprovalDecision] --based on--> [CompanyPolicy]
   [ApprovalDecision] --based on--> [Budget]
   [ApprovalDecision] --based on--> [Entitlement]
   ```
   
### Knowledge Graph Implementation
1. Use a graph database (e.g., Neo4j) to represent the ontology.
2. Nodes: Employee, TripRequest, Manager, ApprovalDecision, CompanyPolicy, Budget, Entitlement.
3. Edges: submits, reviewed by, results in, based on.

### Multi-Agent System
1. Agents: TripRequestAgent, ApprovalAgent, PolicyAgent, BudgetAgent, EntitlementAgent.
2. TripRequestAgent collects trip requests and forwards them to ApprovalAgent. 
3. ApprovalAgent coordinates with PolicyAgent, BudgetAgent, and EntitlementAgent to evaluate requests.
4. Each agent uses semantic reasoning over the KG to make decisions and progressively improve its expertise.
5. Agents log their reasoning steps and decisions for explainability.

### Explainability Layer
1. Capture decision paths: Each agent records the reasoning steps taken to arrive at a decision.
2. Conflict resolution: Highlight any conflicts between agents and how they were resolved.
3. Prioritized explanations: Generate human-readable explanations for each decision, focusing on the most relevant factors.
4. Progressive disclosure: Allow users to explore explanations at different levels of detail.

### Explainability Data Model
1. DecisionTrace: Records the sequence of reasoning steps taken by agents.
2. ConflictRecord: Captures conflicts between agents and their resolutions.

### Web-Based Interface
